I started maintaining this README several years ago and have found the process, the self-reflection, valuable. It is still longer than I'd like, but I want it to maintain my voice and not sound like something ripped from an influencer's blog.

The short version is:

> I enjoy helping and supporting others, and recognize our shared humanity.

Put into the software development context:

> I like to help product development teams do their job well, and find joy in it.

## How I view my role

My role is to build a healthy team environment; where the team displays:
 * Trust,
 * Safe conflict,
 * Commitment,
 * Fearlessness,
 * Accountability, and
 * Sustainable results

Some of the ways I contribute toward this goal:
 * Get to know you and the team, gain mutual understanding & trust
 * Collect and share business context for the team to prioritize, set goals and facilitate decision-making
 * Remove roadblocks
 * Reduce noise & distractions, such as pushing back on unrealistic expectations
 * Encourage your growth
 * Resolve conflicts, either as advisor or mediator
 * (Also happy to brew the coffee, order food, sweep the floor, ... whatever it takes)

## What to expect of me

 * I will praise your successes publicly.
 * I will discuss critiques privately with you.
 * I will not micromanage you.
 * I will listen and support you.
 * I will stay involved, I love working alongside other engineers, in coding, design discussions and code reviews.
 * I will encourage and challenge you to grow, both technically and non-technically.
 * I will provide clarity, and answers. If I don\'t have an answer for you (or am not at liberty to share it with you), I will tell you. As much as possible, I will try to find the answer and get back to you.

## What I expect from you

 * Operate with integrity and empathy, at all times.
 * Do your job well. Help your team mates do their job well.
 * Speak up. Question assumptions. Recommend alternatives. Ask for help.
 * Recognize & celebrate the great work your co-worker is doing.
 * Take ownership. Hold yourself accountable. Be engaged.
 * When you notice a problem, expose it or solve it.
 * Share your thoughts and concerns so we can work together to improve results
 * Volunteer to learn/do something new

_Do not forsake your personal life for work. By coming to work rested and happy, you will be much more productive and engaged._

## Communication and schedules

Everyone has different ways of communicating and different comfort levels with speaking in groups. I try to provide everyone time to reflect and give feedback in ways that best suit them. I am always happy to present the dissenting opinions, if you are ever uncomfortable in larger settings.

 * Extemporaneous speaking is not my favorite thing, I prefer to know the agenda ahead of time, so I can be prepared.
 * I am organized and like to know what to expect. When I schedule a time with you, I\'ll let you know what it is regarding.
 * I like predictability, and try to avoid haphazard scheduling. Of course, sometimes, emergencies occur.
 * If it is urgent, let me know. If you can\'t find time on my calendar, contact me, we will work something out.

_I will always find time for you._

### Meetings

* I do not like ineffective meetings. I try to ensure my meetings are productive.
* I take notes, list action items and owners, and send summaries.
* My default is a 15-minute time slot, and buffer time between meetings.
* I prefer establishing routine recurring meetings. By establishing a regular cadence, we can better plan our days and come prepared to the meetings. If there are no agenda items for a weekly meeting, I will happily cancel it.

### Stand-ups

As teams have gotten more distributed, _asynchronous_ channels of communication, such as Slack, have taken the place of traditional in-person stand-ups. Stand-ups are for coordination of the teamâ€™s effort toward its goals, organizing collaboration, adapting daily to new information, and to bond as a team. I have seen this work most effectively where the team can see and hear each other in real time. In-person, phone or video chat are ideal. This can work over Slack, however, timing is a key element. If the team posts their messages within the same 10 minute time period, then everyone can be engaged. If updates span and entire morning you lose a lot of potential value. Additionally, I dislike the Bots that I have used because they an added level of detachment from your team mates. The more asynchronous the communication, the less value is generated from the practice. In this most detached form,you can definitely still bond as a team by sharing about your day but you lose many of the other benefits of real time communication.

### One on Ones

I will setup one on one meetings with you, for 20-30 minutes once per week. We can refine the schedule over time. These are not for status updates; though we may talk about project work, if necessary. This is our chance to partner together on your goals, growth and provide two-way feedback.

If there is a serious or urgent matter to discuss, it _should not wait_ for the scheduled timeslot.

## Feedback

Giving feedback is key to psychological safety and should meet the following criteria:

 *	**Safety**: You should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback
 *	**Low Effort**: Neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback
 *	**High Benefit**: Giving/receiving feedback should have impact

## Quirks

 * I take notes, lots of notes. I will probably do this during our conversations. I am not ignoring you or working on something else.
 * As an introvert, I tend to keep quieter in larger settings. I am more likely to provide feedback after taking some time to assess and reflect.
 * I dislike arrogance and ego. Individuals who display these characteristics, more than any other, damage teams.
