# How I view my role

My role is to enable the success and health of the team and product(s).

Some of the ways I contribute toward this goal:
 * Get to know you and the team, gain mutual understanding, build trust
 * Collect and share business context for the team to prioritize, set goals and make decisions
 * Remove roadblocks
 * Reduce noise & distractions, such as pushing back on unrealistic expectations
 * Encourage your growth 
 * Foster teamwork 
 * Resolve conflicts, either as advisor or mediator.
 * (Brew the coffee, order food, sweep the floor)

Most importantly, I will listen to you and advocate for you.

# What to expect of me

I strive to operate with integrity and empathy, at all times. If you ever feel I have failed at demonstrating these values, tell me.

I will praise your successes publicly. When I have concerns and critiques, I will share them privately. 

I will not micromanage you. You were hired because you are capable.

I will listen. And, give the best advice or guidance I can.

I will back you up and support you. I want you to innovate without fear. Being part of my team means, I will take responsibility for the decisions that do not work out. And celebrate your successes when they do.

I will stay involved, in design discussions and code reviews.

I will encourage you and also challenge you to grow, both technically and non-technically.

If I don’t have an answer for you or am not at liberty to share it with you, I will tell you. As much as possible, I will try to find the answer and get back to you.

I take notes. Lots of notes. I will probably do this during our conversation, so I don’t forget an important detail. I am not ignoring you or working on something else. 


# What I expect from you

Operate with integrity and empathy, at all times.

Do your job well. Help your team mates do their job well. 

Speak up. Question assumptions. Recommend alternatives. 

Recognize & celebrate the great work your co-worker is doing.

Take ownership. Hold yourself accountable. Be engaged.

When you notice a problem, I prefer it when you present me with a solution.

Share your thoughts and concerns so we can work together to improve results

Do not forsake your personal life for work. By coming to work rested and happy, you will be much more productive and engaged.

_And, you will make me smile when you:_

Continue to improve your skills. Learn a new language, technology, & practice new techniques. 

Volunteer to lead a project, take on a new challenge


# Communication

Everyone has different ways of communicating and different comfort levels with speaking in groups. I try to provide everyone time to reflect and give feedback in ways that best suit them. I am always happy to present the dissenting opinions, if you are ever uncomfortable in larger settings.

Extemporaneous speaking is not my strong suit, I will probably ramble. (Though I am better at it than I used to be.)

In emergencies I have no problem making quick decisions but I prefer to think through the available options, pose questions, seek outside opinions and recommendations.

If I am presenting to a group, I prefer to come prepared with slides and/or notes. 

In order of urgency [high to low], communicate with me: in-person, phone call (crisis), text message (urgent), Slack/IM, email.

## Schedules

Most likely, my calendar will be pretty packed. I will always find time for you. 

If it is urgent, let me know. If you can’t find time on my calendar, contact me, we will work something out. 

## Meetings

I do not like ineffective meetings. I try to ensure my meetings are productive. If you feel I haven’t done this, let me know. Meetings must have a clear purpose (agenda). I will take notes, list action items and owners and send summaries. My default is a 15-minute time slot and I try to keep 10-15 minutes between meetings, so I can summarize and prepare for the next meeting.

I prefer to establish routine recurring meetings. By establishing a regular cadence, we can better plan our days and come prepared to the meetings. If there are no agenda items for a weekly meeting, I will happily cancel it.

## Stand-ups

As teams have gotten more distributed, asynchronous channels of communication, such as Slack, have taken the place of traditional in-person stand-up. Still I am happy to hold stand-ups, if the team finds them valuable.

However, stand-ups (if you hold them) are not status meetings. Meaning, I don’t need to know you are working on your assigned task. I assume you are doing your job. Tools are there to provide status. We should use them. Stand-ups are for coordinating the team’s effort toward its goals, sharing problems and improvements, and to bond as a team. 

# One on Ones

I will setup one on one meetings with you, for 20-30 minutes once per week. We can refine the schedule over time. These are not for status updates; though we may talk about project work, if necessary. This is our chance to partner together on your goals, growth and feedback. If there is a serious or urgent matter to discuss, it should not wait for the scheduled timeslot.

We may discuss future goals and improvements, concerns with team relationships, work-life balance and professional development. As a part of my commitment to you, if there are specific growth areas, (technologies or languages) or I see an opportunity for your growth, we will discuss how/when to work on them. 

In addition to giving you feedback, I will ask you for feedback on how I am doing as your manager. 

## Feedback

Giving feedback should meet the following criteria:
 *	**Safety** (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback)
 *	**Effort** (neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback)
 *	**Benefit** (giving/receiving feedback should have impact)


# Quirks

As an introvert, I tend to keep quieter in larger settings. Typically, I will provide feedback after a short period of reflection.

“Just tell me what you want me to do”, is one of my least favorite responses to hear from someone.

I dislike arrogance.
