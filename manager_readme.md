## How I view my role

My role is to build a healthy team environment; where the team displays:
 * trust,
 * (safe) conflict,
 * commitment (to the team\'s goals),
 * accountability, and
 * sustainable results

Some of the ways I contribute toward this goal:
 * Get to know you and the team, gain mutual understanding & trust
 * Collect and share business context for the team to prioritize, set goals and facilitate decision-making
 * Remove roadblocks
 * Reduce noise & distractions, such as pushing back on unrealistic expectations
 * Encourage your growth
 * Resolve conflicts, either as advisor or mediator
 * (Also happy to brew the coffee, order food, sweep the floor, ... whatever it takes)

## What to expect of me

 * I will praise your successes publicly. When I have concerns and critiques, I will share them privately with you.
 * I will not micromanage you. You were hired because you are capable.
 * I will listen. And, give the best support, advice or guidance I can.
 * I will stay involved, I love working alongside other engineers, in coding, design discussions and code reviews.
 * I will encourage and also challenge you to grow, both technically and non-technically.
 * I will provide clarity, and answers. If I don\'t have an answer for you (or am not at liberty to share it with you), I will tell you. As much as possible, I will try to find the answer and get back to you.

## What I expect from you

 * Operate with integrity and empathy, at all times.
 * Do your job well. Help your team mates do their job well.
 * Speak up. Question assumptions. Recommend alternatives. Ask for help.
 * Recognize & celebrate the great work your co-worker is doing.
 * Take ownership. Hold yourself accountable. Be engaged.
 * When you notice a problem, fix it or provide a solution.
 * Share your thoughts and concerns so we can work together to improve results
 * Volunteer to learn/do something new

_Do not forsake your personal life for work. By coming to work rested and happy, you will be much more productive and engaged._

## Communication

Everyone has different ways of communicating and different comfort levels with speaking in groups. I try to provide everyone time to reflect and give feedback in ways that best suit them. I am always happy to present the dissenting opinions, if you are ever uncomfortable in larger settings.

 * Extemporaneous speaking is not my favorite thing, I prefer a known agenda so I can be prepared.

### Schedules

 * I am organized and like to know what to expect. When I schedule a time with you, I\'ll let you know what it is regarding.
 * I like predictability, and try to avoid haphazard scheduling. Of course, sometimes, emergencies occur.
 * If it is urgent, let me know. If you can\'t find time on my calendar, contact me, we will work something out.

_I will always find time for you._

### Meetings

* I do not like ineffective meetings. I try to ensure my meetings are productive.
* I take notes, list action items and owners, and send summaries.
* My default is a 15-minute time slot, and buffer time between meetings.
* I prefer establishing routine recurring meetings. By establishing a regular cadence, we can better plan our days and come prepared to the meetings. If there are no agenda items for a weekly meeting, I will happily cancel it.

## Stand-ups

As teams have gotten more distributed, _asynchronous_ channels of communication, such as Slack, have taken the place of traditional in-person stand-ups. Still I am happy to hold stand-ups, if the team finds them valuable.

However, stand-ups are not status meetings. Meaning, I don\'t need to hear that you are working on your assigned task. I assume you are doing your job. Tools are there to provide status; use them. Stand-ups are for coordinating the teamâ€™s effort toward its goals, sharing problems and improvements, and to bond as a team.

## One on Ones

I will setup one on one meetings with you, for 20-30 minutes once per week. We can refine the schedule over time. These are not for status updates; though we may talk about project work, if necessary. This is our chance to partner together on your goals, growth and provide two-way feedback.

If there is a serious or urgent matter to discuss, it _should not wait_ for the scheduled timeslot.

## Feedback

Giving feedback should meet the following criteria:
 *	**Safety** (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback)
 *	**Effort** (neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback)
 *	**Benefit** (giving/receiving feedback should have impact)

(Yes, this is basic psychological safety, but I agree with it and want it on record.)

## Quirks

 * I take notes, lots of notes. I will probably do this during our conversations, so I don\'t forget an important detail. I am not ignoring you or working on something else.

 * As an introvert, I tend to keep quieter in larger settings. I am more likely to provide feedback after taking some time to assess and reflect.

 * I dislike arrogance and ego. Individuals who display these characteristics, more than any other, damage teams.
