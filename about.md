title: My story
---


Currently, I am the Directory of Software Development at Gozynta, LLC. I am a software engineering leader focused on Software Craftsmanship,  Distributed Systems, and Software Delivery best practices. I have worked with multiple technology start-ups over the past twenty years.

Prior to entering software development, my early career was in music. I spent a few years as a freelance audio engineer, eventually running my own recording studio and independent record label in the mid-90s at the dawn of digital music production.

Digging deeper into computer technology led me to discover a newly released little operating system called Linux, around 1995. After spending too many nights playing "adventure", and compiling XFree86 on Slackware from dozens of floppy disks, I switched careers from audio engineering to software engineering.

While I am passionate about software development, the most important thing to me is how we can better relate to each other as human beings.
