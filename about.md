## A little about me

As an engineering leader, I have managed globally distributed teams, delivered data-driven SDLC changes, and successfully led turn-arounds of under-performing teams. I work to build highly engaged, productive teams who deliver well-crafted products. My teams have built industry-leading solutions, recognized by Gartner and KLAS.

Professionally, I have designed and implemented globalized, distributed enterprise systems on Windows and Linux platforms including networking, fault-tolerance, security, scripting, service APIs (REST, RPC, SOAP, etc), user interfaces (web, desktop GUI), using a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), trained and mentored teams on continuous delivery, test automation and test-driven development (TDD) practices. See my [manager readme](manager_readme.md) for more about working with me.

Personally, I enjoy exploring new languages and technologies, such as Swift, Dart, [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org), orchestration (Ansible/Kubernetes), containers (Docker), new/various development frameworks and cloud services, and engineering process, e.g. Agile/Kanban/Lean.

I also feel strongly about volunteering in my community and spent many years as a YMCA Swim Official and brought "[Hour of code](https://hourofcode.com/)" into the local elementary school, and facilitated an "Introductory programming" elective at a local High school.


## Memorable moments

After delivering SSO & RFID reader support and Software Development Kit (SDK) and validation tools for Linux thin clients (VDI) on ARM & Intel processors to partners including Dell Wyse, HP SmartZero, & Teradici.

> I am impressed by the work and it shows that the system was designed with partners in mind.
> _John Atkins, Product Manager, Wyse_

After leading the turn-around of the Sustained Engineering function at Caradigm, where I managed a distributed 8-person team in U.S. and India to meet 100% of our SLA goals within 6 months; the team released 50+ patches and resolved 150+ support escalations in 12 months. I received the 2013 Caradigm Employee Recognition Award.

> You turned the SE function around and our [KLAS](https://www.klasresearch.com) scores are already improving. You and your team have direct impact on the success of the IAM business."
> _Ralf Klein, VP IAM Products, Caradigm_

At Microsoft, where I intervened and helped the team resolve virtualization and scalability issues of CentOS Linux server cluster onto Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.

> Thanks for jumping in and driving the CentOS perf evaluation, [packaging, and build work]. You've had a major impact on V5"
> _John Lammers, Senior Development Lead, Microsoft_
