## A little about me

Before entering software engineering, around '98, I was a musician and audio engineer, and owned and operated a recording studio. My taste in music is rather eclectic. Punk, New Wave, Reggae, Fusion, Funk, Ska, Downtempo, Ambient House, Hard Bop, & Free Jazz are some of my favorite genres.

As a software engineer, I place myself squarely in the Software Craftsmanship school. Early experience at a Boston-area startup (2000-2005), where we practiced XP, played a big and influential role in shaping my habits & beliefs in software development. Most of my development career has involved the standard, general purpose languages and OO paradigms (Java, C#, Javascript), and has included lots of UI work (mostly, but not exclusively, with HTML/CSS). In my personal development, I lean towards pure-functional languages, almost exclusively. [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org) is a recent favorite. Thankfully, Python and Javascript (and, now, many others) support aspects of functional programming, so that’s cool.

My schooling has been varied. I majored in Sound Engineering, then English (I switched majors once I realized I had more recording experience entering the program than the seniors who were leaving it), then went back to The Recording Workshop for further programs in Audio engineering & Mastering. Then, after running my recording studio for a few years, at the dawn of electronic/digital production, fell in love with working on computers and went back to earn my Bachelors at Daniel Webster College in NH. I have always wanted to enter a Masters program but family life has kept me from starting that yet.

Professionally, I have designed and implemented globalized, distributed enterprise systems on Windows and Linux platforms including networking, fault-tolerance, security, scripting, service APIs (REST, RPC, SOAP, etc), user interfaces (web, desktop GUI), using a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), trained and mentored teams on continuous delivery, test automation and test-driven development (TDD) practices.  As an engineering leader, I have managed globally distributed teams, delivered data-driven SDLC changes, and successfully led turn-arounds of under-performing teams. I work to build highly engaged, productive teams who deliver well-crafted products. My teams have built industry-leading solutions, recognized by Gartner and KLAS.

While I am passionate about software development, the most important thing to me is the valuation of humanity. I like to work on products that make improve peoples lives. I like to help co-workers and customers find joy and satisfaction in their lives. The trendy term is probably “authenticity” but, whatever, I have always been a bit of an anarchist so I don’t care too much about trends. I spent many years as a Swim Official for the YMCA, brought "[Hour of code](https://hourofcode.com/)" into our local elementary school, and facilitated an "Introductory programming" elective at a my High school alma-mater.


## Memorable moments

After delivering SSO & RFID reader support and Software Development Kit (SDK) and validation tools for Linux thin clients (VDI) on ARM & Intel processors to partners including Dell Wyse, HP SmartZero, & Teradici.

> I am impressed by the work and it shows that the system was designed with partners in mind.
> _John Atkins, Product Manager, Wyse_

After leading the turn-around of the Sustained Engineering function at Caradigm, where I managed a distributed 8-person team in U.S. and India to meet 100% of our SLA goals within 6 months; the team released 50+ patches and resolved 150+ support escalations in 12 months. I received the 2013 Caradigm Employee Recognition Award.

> You turned the SE function around and our [KLAS](https://www.klasresearch.com) scores are already improving. You and your team have direct impact on the success of the IAM business."
> _Ralf Klein, VP IAM Products, Caradigm_

At Microsoft, where I intervened and helped the team resolve virtualization and scalability issues of CentOS Linux server cluster onto Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.

> Thanks for jumping in and driving the CentOS perf evaluation, [packaging, and build work]. You've had a major impact on V5"
> _John Lammers, Senior Development Lead, Microsoft_
