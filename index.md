As an engineering leader, I have managed globally distributed teams, delivered [data-driven SDLC changes](data_driven.md), and successfully led turn-arounds of under-performing teams. I work to build highly engaged, productive teams who deliver well-crafted products. My teams have built industry-leading solutions, recognized by Gartner and KLAS.

Professionally, I have designed and implemented globalized enterprise systems on Windows and Linux platforms, using a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), trained and mentored teams on continuous delivery, test automation and test-driven development (TDD) practices.

Personally, I enjoy following developments in web development, such as [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org), containerization and CI/CD, as well as, development frameworks and methods, e.g. Agile/Kanban/Lean. 

See my [resume](files/andrew_hamlin_resume.pdf) and [manager readme](manager_readme.md) for additional insights about me.

After leading the turn-around of the Sustained Engineering function at Caradigm, where I managed a distributed 8-person team in U.S. and India to meet 100% of our SLA goals within 6 months; the team released 50+ patches and resolved 150+ support escalations in 12 months. I received the 2013 Caradigm Employee Recognition Award.

> You turned the SE function around and our [KLAS](https://www.klasresearch.com) scores are already improving. You and your team have direct impact on the success of the IAM business."

At Microsoft, where I intervened and helped the team resolve virtualization and scalability issues of CentOS Linux server cluster onto Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.

> Thanks for jumping in and driving the CentOS perf evaluation, [packaging, and build work]. You've had a major impact on V5"
