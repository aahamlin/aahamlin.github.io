# Andrew A Hamlin

My software engineering interests and guiding principles come from my early exposure to Extreme Programming. I have continued striving for continual improvements and simplifications in the engineering process, architecture and design throughout my career. I have captured "how to work with me" in my [manager readme](manager_readme.md).

Professionally, I have designed and implemented globalized enterprise systems on Windows and Linux platforms, using a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), trained and mentored teams on continuous delivery, test automation and test-driven development (TDD) practices. Personally, I enjoy following developments in web development, such as [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org), and containerization and CI/CD.

## Highlights

Quotes from co-workers and customers I am proud of:

On delivering SSO & RFID reader support and Software Development Kit (SDK) and validation tools for Linux thin clients (VDI) on ARM & Intel processors to partners including Dell Wyse, HP SmartZero, & Teradici.

> "I am impressed by the work and it shows that the system was designed with partners in mind."
> _John Atkins, Product Manager, Wyse_

After leading the turn-around of the Sustained Engineering function at Caradigm, where I managed a distributed 8-person team in U.S. and India to meet 100% of our SLA goals within 6 months; the team released 50+ patches and resolved 150+ support escalations in 12 months. I received the 2013 Caradigm Employee Recognition Award.

> "You turned the SE function around and our [KLAS](https://www.klasresearch.com) scores are already improving. You and your team have direct impact on the success of the IAM business."
> _Ralf Klein, VP IAM Products, Caradigm_

At Microsoft, where I intervened and helped the team resolve virtualization and scalability issues of CentOS Linux server cluster onto Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.

> "Thanks for jumping in and driving the CentOS perf evaluation, [packaging, and build work]. You've had a major impact on V5"
> _John Lammers, Senior Development Lead, Microsoft_
