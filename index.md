# A little about me

As an engineering leader, I have managed globally distributed teams, delivered data-driven SDLC changes, and successfully led turn-arounds of under-performing teams. I work to build highly engaged, productive teams who deliver well-crafted products. My teams have built industry-leading solutions, recognized by Gartner and KLAS.

Professionally, I have designed and implemented globalized enterprise systems on Windows and Linux platforms, using a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC), trained and mentored teams on continuous delivery, test automation and test-driven development (TDD) practices.

Personally, I enjoy following developments in web development, such as [Elm](https://www.elm-lang.org), containerization and CI/CD, as well as, development frameworks and methods, e.g. Agile/Kanban/Lean. 

See my [manager readme](manager_readme.md) for more about working with me.
