![My Photo](/files/Hamlin 325.jpeg){:class="img-profile img-responsive-33 pull-right"}In addition to building software, I love to read, collect and listen to music, write and record music, play drums, and skateboard. I run a Digital Audio Workstation on [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org/). I may post about these things, occasionally.

I almost always have some side project underway, a few of them maybe interesting or useful to others and are available on github.com or bitbucket.com, see the [projects](projects.md) page.
