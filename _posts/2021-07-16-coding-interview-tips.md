Contrary to what most companies and hiring managers believe, that technical interviews evaluate your ability to program, the coding interview is really testing is your [response to stress](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response).

More than likely, you can solve any coding challenge you will encounter in an interview (calibrated to the level/position you are applying for, of course). The real challenge is combatting the internal anxiety, the [fight-or-flight response](https://www.psychologytools.com/resource/fight-or-flight-response/), that comes from being judged competent enough to gain employment or not. Are you worthy enough to gain membership into this particular software development team?

This semi-irrational fear can be seriously detrimental. You need to earn money to eat and have a roof over your head, and how will you provide for your spouse/partner/kids, how will you save for emergencies, and how much can you save for retirements? And.. and... and...

Thoughts spiral out of control pretty quickly. Everything will be okay... as long as you can implement this binary search algorithm in the next 15 minutes, without mistakes and without sweating enough that this dude in the wrinkled t-shirt, conspicuously hiding his stare ("I wonder what he's writing about me? I bet he's noting how long its taken me to start typing.") while taking notes, will think you get stressed out under pressure ("This is just a simple exercise, I do things harder than this all the time, how much time has gone by?").

If you are wired anything like me, this probably sounds all too familiar. And has probably played out in your head many times in your career. That's pretty much how I always feel under these conditions. The coding interview is one of a handful of encounters that will very quickly cause my brain to completely and utterly lock up. What starts as a simple coding exercise turns into an existential crisis in about a minute and a half.

So what should you do? [DON'T PANIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic)

Here is a stragey that helped me, and I hope will help you. If your evaluation is in person, memorize it, take your notecard with you, read it as many times as you can before/in-between the interview stages. If you're doing a video interview/assessment, write this on a note card and tape it to your monitor.


## Steps for a Coding Interview

It's okay to take a few minutes to think the problem through. It's okay to write notes to yourself. When you're ready, breathe and use these simple steps. After step one, explain what you plan to do.

1. Ask clarifying questions, breakdown the problem, and strategize a solution.

2. Write a test for one task

3. Write the code for the test

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until done

Basically, apply TDD to the coding exercise. Identify the goal, write a failing test (red), write code to make the test pass (green), and make the code better as you go along (refactor), repeat until the problem is done.

> **Pro tip:** If the interviewer says, "You don't need to write tests for this", consider politely saying, "Thank you for your time. I don't think this is the opportunity for me. Good luck filling your role."

When your anxiety peeks again, breathe, look at your notes, and reset your focus on the next immediate step!
