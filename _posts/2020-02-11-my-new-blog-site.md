Everywhere I look there are messages to "brand" ourselves to achieve success. And, admittedly, I have tried over the years. Originally, this one was built as a career-related branding tool. <!--more--> Publishing my first attempt at a [Manager Readme](manager_readme.md). That was written while interviewing at a cool, little startup company about a year ago, unfortunately budget issues closed all open reqs at the time, but it was a good exercise, even though I found it really difficult to write about myself in that way. Recently, I was reading James Stanier's post [Why I couldn't write a manager README](https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/why-i-couldnt-write-a-manager-readme/), and his words resonated with me.

The whole idea of "branding" myself, in terms of software product development is built on the premise that I have some ground-breaking new theory or exceptional capability that before me did not exist. I am uncomfortable with, and probably lack, the predilection for, the narcissism required for such a proclamation. Though I certainly have my own unique perspective on the world and, specifically, what makes for great software development practices and team cultures; these are generally responsive to the situations I am confronting on a particular day.

When considering how to refresh this site, I asked myself, do I really have anything unique to add to the world of blogs and books and articles? And my answer is, eh, not really.

If I am not going to try to impress the software development world with my technical and leadership acumen, then what the heck is the point? Is there any reason to write a blog at all? What do I feel comfortable writing about publicly? Well, I love to read, collect & listen to music, write and record music on Gentoo Linux. And having a place to organize my notes about all these topics will be useful... for myself, and maybe for you too.
